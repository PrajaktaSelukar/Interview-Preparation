# Interview-Preparation
In this repository I am trying to upload regularly the solutions to the questions I practised to uplift my coding ability.

I have divided the questions into two parts - Basic and Intermediate.

I tried to solve a single problem in different approaches to understand how to build a solution from Naive method till we optimize its time and space complexity.

I hope this help you in your coding journey and feel free to fork or download this repo.

If you have any doubt connect with me on [LinkedIn](www.linkedin.com/in/prajakta-selukar97).
